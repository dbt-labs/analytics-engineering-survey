Leadership in many organizations prefers low/no code tools and doesn't want to hire data engineers, so they invest in these tools which break as data grows and evolves. The proliferation of SaaS solutions has exacerbated this issue, since these SaaS providers are better at marketing to leadership than their own developers. In my own organization, we would be much better off running DBT jobs from Airflow than using DBT Cloud, since DBT Cloud regular fails due to worker timeout on our large datasets. But we only have two data engineers, myself included, and leadership doesn't want more code to maintain."
